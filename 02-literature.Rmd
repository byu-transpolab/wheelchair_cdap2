Recent analysis [@Brumbaugh2018] of the 2017 NHTS suggests there are 13.4
million individuals individuals in the US with travel-limiting disabilities --- as defined by a
specific question in the NHTS and encompassing sight, ambulatory, hearing, and
other disabilities. Of these individuals, 20 percent (or 2.7
million) use wheelchairs. With the relative aging of the U.S. population, the
share of Americans with all disabilities as well as those using wheelchairs is
likely to rise substantially [@Sweeney2004; Laplante2003].

The question of how the travel behavior of individuals with travel-limiting
disabilities varies from the travel behavior of individuals without these
disabilities has been addressed previously in a number of studies. That said,
the literature on this topic is relatively fragmented due to the wide variety of
specific disabilities people. The literature also has suffered from a relatively
fragmented approach; rather than considering how disability manifests at each
hierarchical level of the transportation decision-making process, the literature
consists largely of ad-hoc studies conducted on a specific, specially collected
dataset.

With regards to travel patterns, surveys of the general population and surveys
specifically targeted at individuals with disabilities both reveal significant and
meaningful differences compared to individuals without disabilities. Specific
findings include that individuals with disabilities leave their homes on fewer
days if ever [@Sweeney2004], make fewer daily trips [@Schmocker2005;
@Brumbaugh2018] make fewer work trips and more healthcare maintenance trips
[@Ermagun2016], rely more on others for their travel [@Sweeney2004]
and have considerably restricted mode choices [@Rosenbloom2007, @Ruvolo2020].
These differences in mobility and activity patterns have important and observed
negative implications for the individual's access to opportunity for employment
[@Rosenbloom2007; @Lubin2012] and social interaction [@Bascom2017; @Velho2016].
Some recent studies have also looked at the meaningful role of developmental [@Wasfi2007]
and intellectual [@Feeley2019] disabilities on travel patterns. 

The underlying reasons why wheelchair users and others with disabilities exhibit
different travel patterns than other individuals are varied, but are 
likely to include both technical and attitudinal barriers. Technical barriers
include poor access to private vehicles
[@VanRoosmalen2010], poorly maintained sidewalk and pedestrian infrastructure
[@frackelton2013measuring], lack of physical access to TNC
vehicles [@Ruvolo2020], bus ramp complication and malfunction [@Velho2016],
and numerous other problems across many modes.
Attitudinal barriers include feeling shame when safety alarms alert all
passengers that a ramp is being deployed or motion sickness when the users 
are forced to travel backwards in the wheelchair priority area [@Velho2016], or
suffering outright discrimination from TNC operators [@Bascom2017].

In spite of this relatively mature literature, however, there has not to
date been a rigorous evaluation of the travel behavior of individuals with 
disabilities within the framework of a travel activity model. As a result,
recent attempts to simulate or model services aimed at this population have
needed to make simplifying assumptions. In an attempt to model demand for a
modern mobility system targeted at wheelchair users in Berlin, @Bischoff2019
simply assumed demand for this service would be similar to current demand for
the regional paratransit system, augmented by a mode shift from taxi. In this
initial study there was no link between the MaaS trips and the daily activities
of the wheelchair users; there was not even a good understanding of likely trip
origin, destination, or length distribution.

Including wheelchair users or wheelchair use status in a regularized travel model
framework would help to fill two important gaps in the current literature. First, 
the comparison would help to illuminate the travel behavior characteristics of
this important population within a framework that is readily understandable 
\emph{vis a vis} other population segments. Second, researchers engaged in
policy and planning work for this population could replace simplifying assumptions
with plausible daily activity patterns rooted in observed behavior.
