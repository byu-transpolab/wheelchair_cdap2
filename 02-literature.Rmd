# Literature {#sec-literature}

The question of how the travel behavior of individuals with disabilities differs
from the travel behavior of those without disabilities has been addressed 
previously in a number of studies. That said, the literature is often confusing
due to the wide variety of specific disabilities people may have: wheelchair use,
other ambulatory disabilities, visual impairment, and a multitude of other 
conditions are each likely to affect an individual's need for accommodation in 
travel --- and perhaps consequently their travel behavior --- in a number of ways.
A number of recent studies have also looked at the role of developmental @Wasfi2007
and intellectual @Feeley2019 disabilities on travel patterns. However,
given the motivations of this research laid out in the introduction, we will attempt to highlight
research on the mobility and activity patterns of wheelchair users, though 
drawing specific distinctions is not always possible.

Among the first considerations is research attempting to quantify the size
of the disabled or wheelchair using population. Data from the 2017 NHTS
suggests that there are 13.4 million individuals with travel-limiting disabilities
in the U.S., of whom 20 percent (or 2.7 million) use wheelchairs @Brumbaugh2018.
Another analysis of Census data suggests that 37 percent of individuals over 
age 65 with disabilities use wheelchairs; both the number of wheelchair users
and the number of total individuals with disabilities are likely to rise 
in the coming years with the relative aging of the U.S. population @Sweeney2004, Laplante2003.

With regards to travel patterns, surveys of the general population and surveys
specifically targeted at individuals with disabilities both reveal significant and
meaningful differences compared to individuals without disabilities. Specific
findings include that individuals with disabilities leave their homes on fewer 
days if ever @Sweeney2004, make fewer daily trips 
@Schmocker2005, Brumbaugh2018, make fewer work trips and more
healthcare maintenance trips @Ermagun2016, rely more on others for their travel @Sweeney2004,
and have considerably restricted mode
choices @Rosenbloom2007, Ruvolo2020. These differences in mobility and activity patterns
have important and observed negative implications for the individual's access to
opportunity for employment @Rosenbloom2007, Lubin2012 and social interaction
@Bascom2017, Velho2016.


The underlying reasons why wheelchair users exhibit different travel patterns
than other individuals are varied and include both technical and attitudinal 
barriers. Technical barriers include poor access to private vehicles
@VanRoosmalen2010, poorly maintained sidewalk and pedestrian infrastructure
@frackelton2013measuring,  lack of physical access to TNC
vehicles @Ruvolo2020, bus ramp complication and malfunction @Velho2016,
and numerous other problems across many modes.
Attitudinal barriers include feeling shame when safety alarms alert all
passengers that a ramp is being deployed or motion sickness when they are forced
to travel backwards in the wheelchair priority area @Velho2016, or 
suffering outright discrimination from TNC operators @Bascom2017.

In spite of this relatively mature literature, however, there has not to
date been a rigorous evaluation of the travel behavior of individuals with 
disabilities within the framework of a travel activity model. As a result,
recent attempts to simulate or model services aimed at this population have
needed to make simplifying assumptions. In an attempt to model demand for a
modern mobility
system targeted at wheelchair users in
Berlin, @Bischoff2019 simply assumed demand for this service
would be similar to current demand for the regional paratransit system, augmented
by a mode shift from taxi. In this initial study there was no link between the
MaaS trips and the daily activities of the wheelchair users; there was not even a
good understanding of likely trip origin, destination, or length distribution.

Including wheelchair users or wheelchair use status in a regularized travel model
framework would help to fill two important gaps in the current literature. First, 
the comparison would help to illuminate the travel behavior characteristics of
this important population within a framework that is readily understandable 
\emph{vis a vis other population segments. Second, researchers engaged in
policy and planning work for this population could replace simplifying assumptions
with plausible daily activity patterns rooted in observed behavior.
