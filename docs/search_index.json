Gregory Macfarlane Brigham Young University gregmacfarlane@byu.edu Nate Lant Brigham Young University natelant@gmail.com 2021-06-16 Abstract Individuals who use wheelchairs or who have other mobility challenges are sometimes unable to effectively access modern mobility as a service (MaaS) systems including application-based ridehailing and on-demand microtransit, etc. Even designing a MaaS targeted at these users is challenging, given the limited prior analysis of their travel and activity patterns. In this research, we present an initial attempt to model the daily activity pattern choice of respondents to the 2017 National Household Travel Survey who self-identify as using a wheelchair. We find that wheelchair use is a significant predictor of activity patterns, with individuals who use wheelchairs considerably less likely to choose out-of-home daily patterns. We additionally find that including wheelchair use as a variable in a model with a common person-type segmentation is statistically preferable to specifying wheelchair users as an independent segment. Further analysis of household-level coordination of daily activity patterns using more detailed surveys is warranted. 1 Introduction "],["literature.html", " 2 Literature", " 2 Literature The question of how the travel behavior of individuals with disabilities differs from the travel behavior of those without disabilities has been addressed previously in a number of studies. That said, the literature is often confusing due to the wide variety of specific disabilities people may have: wheelchair use, other ambulatory disabilities, visual impairment, and a multitude of other conditions are each likely to affect an individuals need for accommodation in travel  and perhaps consequently their travel behavior  in a number of ways. A number of recent studies have also looked at the role of developmental and intellectual disabilities on travel patterns. However, given the motivations of this research laid out in the introduction, we will attempt to highlight research on the mobility and activity patterns of wheelchair users, though drawing specific distinctions is not always possible. Among the first considerations is research attempting to quantify the size of the disabled or wheelchair using population. Data from the 2017 NHTS suggests that there are 13.4 million individuals with travel-limiting disabilities in the U.S., of whom 20 percent (or 2.7 million) use wheelchairs . Another analysis of Census data suggests that 37 percent of individuals over age 65 with disabilities use wheelchairs; both the number of wheelchair users and the number of total individuals with disabilities are likely to rise in the coming years with the relative aging of the U.S. population . With regards to travel patterns, surveys of the general population and surveys specifically targeted at individuals with disabilities both reveal significant and meaningful differences compared to individuals without disabilities. Specific findings include that individuals with disabilities leave their homes on fewer days if ever , make fewer daily trips , make fewer work trips and more healthcare maintenance trips , rely more on others for their travel , and have considerably restricted mode choices . These differences in mobility and activity patterns have important and observed negative implications for the individuals access to opportunity for employment and social interaction . The underlying reasons why wheelchair users exhibit different travel patterns than other individuals are varied and include both technical and attitudinal barriers. Technical barriers include poor access to private vehicles , poorly maintained sidewalk and pedestrian infrastructure , lack of physical access to TNC vehicles , bus ramp complication and malfunction , and numerous other problems across many modes. Attitudinal barriers include feeling shame when safety alarms alert all passengers that a ramp is being deployed or motion sickness when they are forced to travel backwards in the wheelchair priority area , or suffering outright discrimination from TNC operators . In spite of this relatively mature literature, however, there has not to date been a rigorous evaluation of the travel behavior of individuals with disabilities within the framework of a travel activity model. As a result, recent attempts to simulate or model services aimed at this population have needed to make simplifying assumptions. In an attempt to model demand for a MaaS system targeted at wheelchair users in Berlin, Bischoff simply assumed demand for this service would be similar to current demand for the regional paratransit system, augmented by a mode shift from taxi. In this initial study there was no link between the MaaS trips and the daily activities of the wheelchair users; there was not even a good understanding of likely trip origin, destination, or length distribution. Including wheelchair users or wheelchair use status in a regularized travel model framework would help to fill two important gaps in the current literature. First, the comparison would help to illuminate the travel behavior characteristics of this important population within a framework that is readily understandable other population segments. Second, researchers engaged in policy and planning work for this population could replace simplifying assumptions with plausible daily activity patterns rooted in observed behavior. "],["methods.html", " 3 Methods 3.1 Data", " 3 Methods library(qwraps2) Activity-based models are a relatively mature construct in travel behavior research and in practical demand forecasting . Activity-based models attempt to recreate the long- and short-term decision patterns of individuals within a chain of econometric and statistical choice models. The specific sub-models included in this chain can vary between specific implementations, but a recent open-source project  ActivitySim  implements a popular set of models . Specifically, the ActivitySim demonstration model is a part of the Travel Model One model for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC, San Francisco Bay) . For simplicity and comparison with other models, we apply the ActivitySim model in this research. The first model in the ActivitySim model chain is a of the type described by Bradley and Vovsha . This model allows individuals to choose one of three daily activity patterns: Mandatory (\\(M\\)) daily patterns revolve around school and work activities that are typically considered non-discretionary. These activities and the travel to them anchor an individuals daily schedule, though other tours are possible. Non-Mandatory (\\(NM\\)) daily patterns involve only discretionary activities: shopping, maintenance, etc. At-Home (\\(H\\)) daily patterns describe the schedule and activities of individuals who never leave the home during the travel day. The choice between the daily patterns is described with a multinomial logit model , where the utility functions for each option are determined by an individuals socioeconomic characteristics and person type segment. The specific innovation of the Bradley and Vovsha model is that the daily activity patterns are coordinated, or that the choice of one individual in a household influences the choice probability of other household members. We leave household-level coordination to future research and instead examine individual uncoordinated choice utilities. We do, however, adopt the person type segmentation strategy employed by ActivitySim; segmentation allows for heterogeneity in available alternatives and utility coefficients between individuals with highly divergent expected behaviors. For example, full time workers and pre-driving age school children will have strongly different responses to income, automobile availability, and and other variables in determining their most likely daily pattern. A complete descriptive list of each person type is given in the data section below. 3.1 Data library(targets) library(kableExtra) Data for this study comes from the 2017 NHTS . We restrict the data to households where the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population size is between one and three million people. There are 76,367 individuals in 36,497 households that responded to the NHTS from these areas, though not all of these records are useful due to missing or incomplete data in key variables. The NHTS releases public data in separate tables for persons, households, trips and vehicles; to determine the daily activity pattern for a given individual it was necessary to transform the trips table into a table of activities. We did this by reconstructing a schedule for each person from the reported trip origin and destination activity codes. We then determined whether each reported tour (a chain of activities away from the individuals home) contained a mandatory school or work activity. If any tour contained a mandatory activity, the persons entire daily activity pattern was classified as mandatory; if not, the daily activity pattern was non-mandatory. By identifying respondents in the persons table without records in the trips table, we can determine individuals with a home daily activity pattern. ActivitySim classifies persons into seven person segments, though we only consider four types in this study, defined as follows: The other three person types are university students, schoolchildren under driving age, and driving-age schoolchildren. A limited number of individuals who could plausibly be considered university students responded to the NHTS, so we cannot estimate reliable choice models. Among schoolchildren of any age, too few report using wheelchairs to justify including these segments in this study. Table shows the observed distribution of daily activity patterns within each person segment. tar_load(dap_stats) kbl(dap_stats) Person Type Home Mandatory Non-Mandatory Full-time Worker 1455 10240 4493 Non-Worker 1171 0 2552 Part-time Worker 416 2142 1470 Retired 2683 0 7377 Total 5725 12623 15892 The NHTS has a number of questions where respondents can indicate a disability for themselves or other household members. Each respondent is asked Do you have a condition or handicap that makes it difficult to travel outside of the home? If the answer is yes, several follow-up questions are asked, including Do you use any of the following medical devices? Select all that apply. The list of medical devices respondents can indicated includes canes, walkers, seeing-eye dogs, crutches, motorized scooters, manual wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, or something else (other). For this study, we identify wheelchair users as respondents who report using a manual wheelchair, mechanical wheelchair, or motorized scooter. The specific variables included in the daily activity pattern choice models are based initially on the variables used in the ActivitySim example model (which are those used in MTC Travel Model One. The variables available include the age of the person and the household income treated as categorical ranges; gender, work, and college degree status are treated as binary values. Automobile availability is included via a binary sufficiency variable where a household with at least as many vehicles as adults is considered auto sufficient. Descriptive statistics of the model variable within each person segment are given in Table . #tar_load(descriptives) #kbl(descriptives) library(targets) library(kableExtra) "],["applications.html", " 4 Applications 4.1 Example one NHTS 4.2 Example two ActivitySim", " 4 Applications Some significant applications are demonstrated in this chapter. 4.1 Example one NHTS We estimated the models using mlogit for R . As described above, the alternatives for daily activity pattern choice are a Mandatory pattern where the individuals day involves a work or school tour, a Non-Mandatory pattern where only discretionary trips are taken, and a Home pattern where the individual does not leave home. In the models estimated for this study, the Home pattern serves as the reference alternative with a utility of zero. Retired and otherwise non-working individuals choose only between Non-Mandatory and Home daily activity patterns. The model estimates are presented in Table . The estimated coefficients are of the expected sign, though not all are significant. Some predictors that proved to be insignificant, such as automobile availability for full-time workers, were excluded from the estimated models. The overall model fit  as indicated by the McFadden \\(\\rho^2\\) with respect to a market shares (constants only) model  is not strikingly high. Were the purpose of this research to identify the best fit model of activity pattern choice for each person segment we would undertake an exercise to include, exclude, and identify potential transformations for different sets of variables. In this case, however, the goal of these models is simply to provide a plausible comparison point for the behavior of individuals using wheelchairs against the behavior of individuals in other person type segments. tar_load(pt_modelsummary) #kbl(pt_modelsummary) In this regard, the model results show strong divergence of the utility preferences of individuals who use wheelchairs. For instance, full-time workers in the middle income groups are modestly less likely to choose non-mandatory patterns, and part-time workers of higher income are less like to choose mandatory patterns. Income appears to have no discernible effect on the choices of non-working and retired individuals. We see a negative utility score for all person types with a wheelchair variable, and mandatory is even more negative. This is expected as individuals with wheelchairs are less likely to take a work or school trip compared to a shopping or a recreational trip. Non-workers and retired person types do not have a coefficient for mandatory DAP because those users by definition do not take mandatory DAP. Indeed, wheelchair use is among the strongest predictors of daily activity pattern choice across population segments. 4.2 Example two ActivitySim As a secondary example, the research measures the impact of wheelchair status on ActivitySims selection of daily plans for our given synthetic population. Given a Before scenario in ActivitySim of the Salt Lake Area and ignoring the newly added wheelchair status in the synthetic population, ActivitySim predicted a DAP for each individual. In a second, After scenario, ActivitySim again predicted a DAP for each person, this time considering the wheelchair use status of each individual in the population. We hypothesized that those with wheelchairs and those in the same households as individuals with wheelchairs would change their DAP because of the negative utility scores applied to the mandatory and nonmandatory DAP alternatives, and the rest of the population would be unaffected. The DAP of those within the same household of a wheelchair user may change because of the coordinated nature of household DAP in ActivitySim. Table 4-6 shows the change in DAP among those with wheelchairs, in the same household as one with a wheelchair, and with neither a wheelchair nor in the same household. The table contains both total volumes and percentages; the value of percent is by total volume in the group, for example, 16.4 percent of Wheelchair Users chose a home pattern in both the Before scenario and the After scenario. The latter group is rightly unaffected by the wheelchair implementation in the simulation (with the exception of a few changes attributable to randomness) and does not include a percentage breakdown. Primarily, DAP remain the same for most individuals, as shown in the diagonal. However, there is a large volume of wheelchair users and their household members that stay home, particularly from nonmandatory DAP. This finding is consistent with our hypothesis. tar_load(dap_table) kbl(dap_table) Group DAP_before H M N Wheelchair Users H 3369 20 459 Wheelchair Users M 932 1642 308 Wheelchair Users N 3584 23 10261 Household Members H 4511 213 631 Household Members M 759 15409 301 Household Members N 1235 415 13119 Not Affected H 309965 2 NA Not Affected M 2 1460582 NA Not Affected N NA 2 659258 "],["final-words.html", " 5 Final Words", " 5 Final Words We have finished a nice book.
