abstract = {Smartphone technology enables dynamic ride-sharing systems that bring together people with similar itineraries and time schedules to share rides on short-notice. This paper considers the problem of matching drivers and riders in this dynamic setting. We develop optimization-based approaches that aim at minimizing the total system-wide vehicle miles incurred by system users, and their individual travel costs. To assess the merits of our methods we present a simulation study based on 2008 travel demand data from metropolitan Atlanta. The simulation results indicate that the use of sophisticated optimization methods instead of simple greedy matching rules substantially improve the performance of ride-sharing systems. Furthermore, even with relatively low participation rates, it appears that sustainable populations of dynamic ride-sharing participants may be possible even in relatively sprawling urban areas with many employment centers.}

	abstract = {Ride-sharing services can provide not only a very personalized mobility experience but also ensure efficiency and sustainability via large-scale ride pooling. Large-scale ride-sharing requires mathematical models and algorithms that can match large groups of riders to a fleet of shared vehicles in real time, a task not fully addressed by current solutions. We present a highly scalable anytime optimal algorithm and experimentally validate its performance using New York City taxi data and a shared vehicle fleet with passenger capacities of up to ten. Our results show that 2,000 vehicles (15\% of the taxi fleet) of capacity 10 or 3,000 of capacity 4 can serve 98\% of the demand within a mean waiting time of 2.8 min and mean trip delay of 3.5 min.Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (i) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (ii) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with \~{}3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.},

    abstract = { Agent-based models have gained wide acceptance in transportation planning because with increasing computational power, large-scale people-centric mobility simulations are possible. Several modeling efforts have been reported in the literature on the demand side (with sophisticated activity-based models that focus on an individual’s day activity patterns) and on the supply side (with detailed representation of network dynamics through simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment models). This paper proposes an extension to a state-of-the-art integrated agent-based demand and supply model—SimMobility—for the design and evaluation of autonomous vehicle systems. SimMobility integrates various mobility-sensitive behavioral models in a multiple time-scale structure comprising three simulation levels: (a) a long-term level that captures land use and economic activity, with special emphasis on accessibility; (b) a midterm level that handles agents’ activities and travel patterns; and (c) a short-term level that simulates movement of agents, operational systems, and decisions at a microscopic granularity. In that context, this paper proposes several extensions at the short-term and midterm levels to model and simulate autonomous vehicle systems and their effects on travel behavior. To showcase these features, the first-cut results of a hypothetical on-demand service with autonomous vehicles in a car-restricted zone of Singapore are presented. SimMobility was successfully used in an integrated manner to test and assess the performance of different autonomous vehicle fleet sizes and parking station configurations and to uncover changes in individual mobility patterns, specifically in regard to modal shares, routes, and destinations. }

    abstract = { Worldwide carsharing has grown significantly in recent years. The traditional round-trip model is no longer the only carsharing model offered. It is now being accompanied by more flexible options such as one-way station-based, free-floating and peer-to-peer carsharing. Moreover, it has become important to have tools that can estimate both the spatial and temporal demand for carsharing services, providing operators with a good instrument for planning their services. The work presented in this paper makes use of the multiagent simulation tool (MATSIM) to investigate the effects of supply on the demand of the existing round-trip service in the Zurich area of Switzerland. Additionally, the results provide guidance for the possible optimization of the carsharing service. Also presented is an implementation of a one-way station-based model as a part of the MATSIM framework as well as an investigation of the potentials of one-way carsharing service in the study area. Results show that there is still untapped potential of round-trip carsharing, but that service might need optimization. Furthermore, because of greater convenience, one-way carsharing would generate slightly less than three times more trips compared with the round-trip option. }

Individual agents express preferences through a utility-maximizing evolutionary algorithm that minimizes each individual's cost and time spent traveling via diverse modal options, including the competition for scarce supply resources such as parking spaces and charging infrastructure. BEAM simulates the essential elements that compose a dynamic transportation system. From the road network, parking and charging infrastructure, to the transit system and a synthetic population with plans and preferences, the virtual system is an amalgamation of multiple spatially resolved layers that together represent an integrated transportation system. BEAM is an extension to the MATSim (Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation) model, where agents employ reinforcement learning across successive simulated days to maximize their personal utility through plan mutation (exploration) and selecting between previously executed plans (exploitation). The BEAM model shifts some of the behavioral emphasis in MATSim from across-day planning to within-day planning, where agents dynamically respond to the state of the system during the mobility simulation. In BEAM, agents can plan across all major modes of travel including driving, walking, biking, transit, and demand-responsive ride hailing.},

A group of 257 older drivers participated in assessments of visual sensory function, eye health and cognitive function including the useful field of view test, and completed a structured questionnaire on driving exposure and how frequently they avoided challenging driving situations. Results replicated earlier studies showing that many older drivers limit their exposure to driving situations which are generally believed to be more difficult (e.g. rain, night, heavy traffic, rush hour). Furthermore, older drivers with objectively determined visual and/or attentional impairments reported more avoidance than those free of impairments; those with the most impairment reported avoiding more types of situations than other less impaired or non-impaired drivers. Older drivers with a history of at-fault crashes in the prior five years reported more avoidance than those who had crash-free records. Future research should evaluate the potentially beneficial role of self-regulation in enhancing older driver safety, particularly in those older drivers with visual and attentional processing impairments who have elevated crash risk.}

The proposed real-time AT dispatching algorithm was optimized to handle hundreds of thousands of vehicles and millions of requests at low computing times. Simulation results suggest, that a fleet of 100 000 vehicles will be enough to replace the car fleet in Berlin at a high service quality for customers.

abstract = {Intra-household interactions constitute an important aspect in modeling activity and travel-related decisions. Recognition of this importance has recently produced a growing body of research on various aspects of modeling intra-household interactions and group decision-making mechanisms as well as first attempts to incorporate intra-household interactions in regional travel demand models. The previously published research works were mostly focused on time allocation aspect and less on generation of activity episodes, trips, and travel tours that are necessary units for compatibility with regional travel demand models. Also, most of the approaches were limited to household heads only and did not consider explicitly the other household members as acting agents in the intra-household decision making. A model is proposed for joint choice of daily activity pattern (DAP) types for all household members that explicitly takes into account added group-wise utilities of joint participation in the same activity. The model is based on the aggregate description of individual DAP types by three main categories - mandatory travel pattern, non-mandatory travel pattern, and at-home pattern. Important intra-household interactions can be captured already at this aggregate level. A choice structure considers all possible combinations of DAPs of all household members as alternatives. Utility function of each alternative includes components corresponding to each individual DAP type as well as group-wise interaction terms that correspond to joint choice of the same pattern by several household members. Statistical analysis of intra-household interactions and estimation results of the choice model are presented. The model estimation has confirmed a strong added utility of joint choice of the same pattern for such person types as non-worker or part time worker in combination with child, two retired persons, two children, and others. The proposed model represents a part of the advanced regional model system being developed for the Atlanta Regional Commission. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

Consisting of 50 million individuals in the United States, with discretionary income of over \$200 billion, this largest of all minority groups has been viewed by many tourist businesses as a source of confusion, requiring extra expenditures on ramps, specially fitted rooms, and the loss of prime parking. This article offers new insights into the possibilities associated with the disabled, including general trends and need sets. Also included are the results of a survey of a cross section of mobility-disabled consumers. Four hypotheses relating severity of disability with destination decision criteria were tested. Results indicate that disability relates to environmental criteria, accessible criteria, and activities criteria. The findings indicate that segmenting the disabled by level of severity is a valuable process and that those with more severe disabilities travel differently and for different reasons. Managerial implications are discussed. }

This likely make the present a very good time for 49 researchers investing their efforts on providing tools for the assessment and planning of carsharing programs. 50 Nevertheless, efforts in this direction are still very few, in particular for some of the newest form in which 51 carsharing has been implemented, like free-floating carsharing.

Whilst the majority of scholarly work has focused on public transport needs, less research has examined the barriers or benefits of access to private modified vehicles for PWD. In this exploratory study, a Delphi technique with health experts, researchers, drivers and funding agencies developed an instrument to examine the barriers and benefits of access to private modified vehicles for PWD. An online survey was completed by 287 drivers and carers to report on barriers to private modified vehicles, whilst a sub-set of 190 drivers with access to a private modified vehicle reported on experientially derived benefits. A factor analytic approach identified how financial and informational barriers vary with respect to several characteristics including disability type and level of support needs. Factors relating to independence, social and recreational benefits are perceived as more valued experientially derived benefits relative to benefits relating to employability and ability to enjoy downtime. Benefits in the form of independence are greater among drivers and owners, those with an acquired condition, less complex mobility and everyday support needs, whilst little difference emerged in terms of the social and downtime benefits. The findings inform policy development and funding opportunities to provide insight and evidence into the barriers, but also benefits and variation in private transport needs among PWD.},

abstract = {The activity and travel patterns of people with disabilities are generally distinct, as their activities are more dependent on others due to their special physical condition. This paper elaborates on the patterns of regular out-of-home activities (i.e. for different trip purposes) of disabled persons along with the way that they are accompanied to perform the activities. Household Travel Tracker Survey data collected by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning is used to develop new travel models. Two multinomial logit models are estimated to explore the influential variables and elaborate the consequences of ignoring their inter-dependency. From the influential parameters perspective, the modeling results indicate that people with limited mobility generate more healthcare trips than other disabled individuals. Elasticity results show that the chance of making a healthcare trip without any escort decreases around 0.8 percent as the age of people with disability increases by one percent. We also find that a one percent increase in trip duration increases escorted healthcare, non-escorted work, and non-escorted school trips by 0.16, 0.23, and 0.32 percent, respectively. From the modeling perspective, pursuant to the independent model, the probability of recreational trips reduces around 9 percent, if household car ownership increases from one to two. However, the joint model predicts a 2 percent increase in this situation for people with physical limitations. Therefore, neglecting the importance of the interaction of these decisions for persons with disabilities can manifest model specification error, leading to unrealistic policy assessments.},

   abstract = {Carsharing programs that operate as short-term vehicle rentals (often for one-way trips before ending the rental) like Car2Go and ZipCar have quickly expanded, with the number of US users doubling every 1-2. years over the past decade. Such programs seek to shift personal transportation choices from an owned asset to a service used on demand. The advent of autonomous or fully self-driving vehicles will address many current carsharing barriers, including users' travel to access available vehicles.This work describes the design of an agent-based model for shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) operations, the results of many case-study applications using this model, and the estimated environmental benefits of such settings, versus conventional vehicle ownership and use. The model operates by generating trips throughout a grid-based urban area, with each trip assigned an origin, destination and departure time, to mimic realistic travel profiles. A preliminary model run estimates the SAV fleet size required to reasonably service all trips, also using a variety of vehicle relocation strategies that seek to minimize future traveler wait times. Next, the model is run over one-hundred days, with driverless vehicles ferrying travelers from one destination to the next. During each 5-min interval, some unused SAVs relocate, attempting to shorten wait times for next-period travelers.Case studies vary trip generation rates, trip distribution patterns, network congestion levels, service area size, vehicle relocation strategies, and fleet size. Preliminary results indicate that each SAV can replace around eleven conventional vehicles, but adds up to 10% more travel distance than comparable non-SAV trips, resulting in overall beneficial emissions impacts, once fleet-efficiency changes and embodied versus in-use emissions are assessed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The latest advances in information technologies such as automatic vehicle location (AVL), digital telecommunication and computers have afforded a unique opportunity for public transit agencies to integrate these technologies in their paratransit systems for improved productivity and reliability. This opportunity has also prompted wide spread interest in quantifying the actual benefits that can be attained from such technological enhancement. The primary objective of the simulation model described in this paper was to facilitate the evaluation of the potential effects that these technologies may bring on a paratransit system. The paper discusses the general concepts, models and computational techniques applied in the simulation system, focusing on how various components are modeled and how they interact with each other in the overall simulation framework.

@book{Horni2016,
abstract = {The MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) software project was started around 2006 with the goal of generating traffic and congestion patterns by following individual synthetic travelers through their daily or weekly activity programme. It has since then evolved from a collection of stand-alone C++ programs to an integrated Java-based framework which is publicly hosted, open-source available, automatically regression tested. It is currently used by about 40 groups throughout the world. This book takes stock of the current status. The first part of the book gives an introduction to the most important concepts, with the intention of enabling a potential user to set up and run basic simulations.The second part of the book describes how the basic functionality can be extended, for example by adding schedule-based public transit, electric or autonomous cars, paratransit, or within-day replanning. For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core. The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis. Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim. All current users of MATSim were invited to submit their work, and many followed with sometimes crisp and short and sometimes longer contributions, always with pointers to additional references. We hope that the book will become an invitation to explore, to build and to extend agent-based modeling of travel behavior from the stable and well tested core of MATSim documented here.},

   abstract = {Safety is a primary concern for the visually impaired when navigating unfamiliar urban environments. Since most environments are constructed to be easily navigated by sighted people, visually impaired people have to often seek help and use secondary clues to navigate many urban environments safely. As a result, daily activities such as using transit systems remain challenging tasks for people with visual impairments even though the use of transit systems is often a key factor for participation in employment, and educational, social, and cultural opportunities. Visually impaired adults have several challenges when navigating unfamiliar environments. First, they must pre-plan their navigation routes as much as possible and need to build a mental map of the new environment they will be navigating. Next, they need to figure out how to navigate between locations of interest from a known environment. They also need to be informed of dynamic changes to the unfamiliar environment which may impact their safe navigation. Furthermore, they need to be able to " record " their navigation experience for future trips and also potentially share this information with others who might find it useful. Finally, if they get into any unsafe or difficult situation while navigating the unfamiliar environment, they need to have a reliable means of getting help. We have been exploring specific needs and constraints encountered by this user population when using transit stations. Based on our findings, we created a set of design guidelines for useful technology targeting this user population and prototyped an accessible smartphone tool that has significant potential to enhance the safety of these travelers. This tool allows travelers to annotate their paths and choose/invite trusted sources to enhance the relevant information that can enhance the safety and efficacy of their travel.},

   abstract = {Short-term passenger demand forecasting is of great importance to the on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies, and exogenous dependencies need to be considered simultaneously, however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependencies within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection. The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China. The experimental results, validated on the real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing, show that the FCL-Net achieves the better predictive performance than traditional approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and state-of-art machine learning algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network, XGBoost, LSTM and CNN). Furthermore, the consideration of exogenous variables in addition to the passenger demand itself, such as the travel time rate, time-of-day, day-of-week, and weather conditions, is proven to be promising, since they reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 48.3%. It is also interesting to find that the feature selection reduces 24.4% in the training time and leads to only the 1.8% loss in the forecasting accuracy measured by RMSE in the proposed model. This paper is one of the first DL studies to forecast the short-term passenger demand of an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal correlations.},

   abstract = {This paper describes the further development of the “travel choice simulator for door-to-door transport services” presented at the previous TRANSED conference. (Bell et al, 2004). The aim of the simulator is to model the travel behavior of London's elderly and disabled citizens with special reference to the subsidized forms of door-to-door transport like Taxicard (subsidized Taxi trips) and Dial-a-Ride (door-to-door transport by minibus), as well as public transport using a Freedom Pass. The innovative part of the model is the attempt to capture the impact of policy changes such as changes in the eligibility to become a member of the Taxicard scheme or changes to the number of trips a member is allowed to make. The software tool comprises several stages: Firstly, a synthetic London-wide population is generated to resemble in terms of key personal characteristics those who might qualify for some form of subsidized transport. Secondly, trip generation by the previously created tripmakers is estimated. Thirdly, the mode choice for these trips is predicted. The final step in the simulation software is the evaluation. In discussion with Transport for London several evaluation measures have been defined which can be displayed and stored at the end of the simulation. The evaluation criteria include among others the subsidy needed as well as the suppressed demand for Taxicard and Dial-a-Ride, which will depend on the budget specifications used for mode choice. The paper discusses the software structure, highlights limitations of the model and presents an initial case study that shows the impact of demographic changes in the population and the impact of policy changes.},

The study used the 2013 Disability and Use of Time data for people ages 50 years and older, many of whom reported physical impairments. The study developed a model that related life satisfaction with various time use, disability, and mobility variables. Summary statistics of time use showed that as people aged, they spent more time on solitary, passive leisure activities; social face-to-face time did not seem to change very much. Alone passive leisure time use was especially large for those who experienced a physical mobility-related disability and were carless. The study used an ordinal logistic regression and found that longer alone leisure time uses were associated with lower life satisfaction. Life satisfaction was positively affected by transportation variables, such as vehicle availability. The study also found that social face-to-face time use had a weak positive relationship with life satisfaction, and technology-mediated social activities had a strong negative relationship with life satisfaction.},

Two architectures of the GCNN-DDGF model are explored; GCNNreg-DDGF is a regular GCNN-DDGF model which contains the convolution and feedforward blocks, and GCNNrec-DDGF additionally contains a recurrent block from the Long Short-term Memory neural network architecture to capture temporal dependencies in the bike-sharing demand series. Furthermore, four types of GCNN models are proposed whose adjacency matrices are based on various bike-sharing system data, including Spatial Distance matrix (SD), Demand matrix (DE), Average Trip Duration matrix (ATD), and Demand Correlation matrix (DC). These six types of GCNN models and seven other benchmark models are built and compared on a Citi Bike dataset from New York City which includes 272 stations and over 28 million transactions from 2013 to 2016. Results show that the GCNNrec-DDGF performs the best in terms of the Root Mean Square Error, the Mean Absolute Error and the coefficient of determination (R2), followed by the GCNNreg-DDGF. They outperform the other models. Through a more detailed graph network analysis based on the learned DDGF, insights are obtained on the “black box” of the GCNN-DDGF model. It is found to capture some information similar to details embedded in the SD, DE and DC matrices. More importantly, it also uncovers hidden heterogeneous pairwise correlations between stations that are not revealed by any of those matrices.}

We investigate the effect of using a zoning vs. a no-zoning strategy and time-window settings on performance measures such as total trip miles, deadhead miles and fleet size. It is difficult to establish closed-form expressions to assess the impact on the performance measures of a specific zoning practice or time-window setting for a real transportation network. Thus, we conduct this study through a simulation model of the operations of DRT providers on a network based on data for DRT service in Los Angeles County. However, the methodology is quite general and applicable to any other service area. Our results suggest the existence of linear relationships between operating practices and performance measures. In particular we observe that for each minute increase in time-window size the service saves approximately 2 vehicles and 260 miles driven and that a no-zoning strategy is able to satisfy the same demand by employing 60 less vehicles and driving 10,000 less total miles with respect to the current zoning strategy.}

Building upon two prior studies from the Institute of Medicine (the 1991 Institute of Medicine's report Disability in America and the 1997 report Enabling America), The Future of Disability in America examines both progress and concerns about continuing barriers that limit the independence, productivity, and participation in community life of people with disabilities. This book offers a comprehensive look at a wide range of issues, including the prevalence of disability across the lifespan; disability trends the role of assistive technology; barriers posed by health care and other facilities with inaccessible buildings, equipment, and information formats; the needs of young people moving from pediatric to adult health care and of adults experiencing premature aging and secondary health problems; selected issues in health care financing (e.g., risk adjusting payments to health plans, coverage of assistive technology); and the organizing and financing of disability-related research. The Future of Disability in America is an assessment of both principles and scientific evidence for disability policies and services. This book's recommendations propose steps to eliminate barriers and strengthen the evidence base for future public and private actions to reduce the impact of disability on individuals, families, and society.},

Subsidizing a taxi service to carry some paratransit demand could potentially reduce the total cost of the service if diverted trips are inexpensive to serve by taxi and the remaining paratransit operations remain efficient. This study makes use of ADA paratransit operations and demand data from the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) in the greater Springfield, Massachusetts, region to develop an algorithm for optimally allocating paratransit demand to conventional paratransit services and taxis. First, a model is presented to optimize the spatial extent of the ADA paratransit service area, assuming that all trips outside the service region can be incentivized to use taxis. A more detailed investigation makes use of survey data from PVTA to estimate which trips could potentially be diverted to taxis or transportation network companies (TNCs) based on the type of disability that a customer has. The result is a model that shows which trips could be incentivized to switch to taxi and the magnitude of total operating cost savings that may be achieved from such a program. }

A case is made for independent mobility for individuals who have disabilities and elderly individuals by first giving an overview of the functional, cognitive, and sensory abilities that are critical for driving. Second, the types of vehicle modifications and state-of-the-art controls that are available and on the horizon are described and the way in which these technologies are selected to meet driver needs is explained. Requirements for driver safety systems for drivers who remain in their wheelchairs are then discussed. Finally, emerging and innovative driving enhancement systems, such as obstacle avoidance and navigation, are discussed, as are their benefits in helping drivers who have disabilities and elderly drivers to experience safe and independent driving. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Velho2016,
abstract = {In recent years the accessibility of London buses has improved with the introduction of ramps and wheelchair priority areas. These advances are meant to remove physical barriers to entering the bus, but new conflicts have arisen particularly over the physical space aboard. We aimed to research the barriers faced by wheelchair users in public transport using a mixed methods approach to establish the breadth of issues faced by wheelchair users. To this end we quantified the push-force used alight a bus and a study to understand the coping mechanisms used by people to propel up a ramp. This quantitative approach found push forces which resulted in a load of 2 to 3 times body weight being transferred through people's shoulders, forces which can be directly linked to shoulder injury. This could disable the user further, preventing them from being able to push their wheelchair. Alongside the quantitative study, we conducted qualitative research comprising of a number of in-depth interviews with wheelchair users about the barriers they face in public transport. Our main claim, highlighted through this interdisciplinary collaboration, is that proposed ‘solutions' to accessibility, such as ramps, often generate problems of their own. These barriers can affect the life of wheelchair users, impacting on their confidence and causing social isolation. These can be long-term in nature or immediate.},

Demand responsive transportation (DRT) is an emerging mainstream concept, which aims to offer flexible mobility services to customers and also to solve the aforementioned problems of CPT providers. Studies and simulations about the comparison of CPT and DRT mostly focus on urban areas. Therefore, this paper is a case study of CPT vs. DRT services in the rural town of Colditz: A stop-based and a door-to-door DRT service is analyzed along with a CPT bus line.}

    abstract = { An activity-based approach to transport demand modeling is considered the most behaviorally sound procedure to assess the effects of transport policies. This paper investigates whether it is possible to transfer an estimated model for activity generation from elsewhere (the estimation context) and use local area (application context) traffic counts to develop a local area activity-based transport demand representation. Here, the estimation context is the Los Angeles, California, area, and the application context is Berlin. Results in this paper suggest that such a transfer approach is feasible, according to a comparison with a Berlin travel survey. Additional studies need to be undertaken to examine the stability of the results obtained in this paper. }

@article{Laplante2003,
abstract = {Assistive mobility devices––including wheelchairs, scooters, canes, crutches, and walkers––are effective ways to alleviate the impact of mobility limitations for many people, permitting more efficient ambulation over long and short distances, increased independence and the promise of full participation in community life. The use of assistive devices increases with age, and because the U.S. population is aging, the use of assistive devices is of ever increasing importance. Increased use of assistive technology may have helped reduce disability at older ages (Manton, Corder, and Stallard, 1993), based on data from the National Long Term Care Survey. However, a recent review of national surveys does not corroborate a decline in ADL level disability at the older ages (Freedman, Martin and Schoeni, 2002), but does conclude that the rate of functional limitations, such as walking a quarter mile, has declined in the older population. Although mobility device users represent only a relatively small minority of the population with disabilities, their importance transcends their numbers. Mobility devices, especially wheelchairs, are visible signs of disability and have become symbols in themselves of the very idea of disability. Understanding the magnitude and characteristics of the population using assistive technologies is therefore of particular importance, as well as understanding how the technologies are used. For mobility devices to be used effectively, the environments in which they are used must be physically accessible. This paper focuses on the population using wheeled mobility devices—wheelchairs and scooters—and trends over time. It provides a profile of their demographic characteristics; health and disability status, including diagnoses and impairments and physical functioning, health insurance status, and unmet needs using the latest available published information supplemented with some original analysis. The accessibility of mobility device users' homes and larger environments is also discussed, demonstrating that improvements in physical accessibility must remain a priority for millions of mobility device users who continue to experience accessibility barriers, as of 1997.},

@article{Ruvolo2020,
abstract = {Thirty years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, people with disabilities still face significant barriers to transportation access. In recent years, new transportation services known as “new mobility” or “emerging mobility” launched entirely without accessible options. These services include transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Lyft and Uber, bike share, scooter share, and car share. Whether cities rush to welcome or grudgingly accept new mobility services, disability access is still too often an afterthought. This report, prepared for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, examines perceptions of new mobility services among disabled people in San Francisco via a survey of 218 people with disabilities. The study finds that disabled people in San Francisco see promise in some new mobility services but currently face significant barriers to use. Out of all new mobility options, respondents were most interested in on-demand automobility, e.g. accessible TNCs or accessible taxis. Respondents expressed significant concern about scooters and dockless bike share blocking the path of travel, and nearly 75 percent reported that an improperly parked scooter or bike created a mobility barrier for them on at least one occasion. Additionally, with broken sidewalks and missing curb ramps common, people with disabilities still face many barriers to basic mobility. This project offers the following recommendations: continue advocating for more effective TNC Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle (WAV) regulations at the state level, address the problem of scooters and bicycles on sidewalks, and build safer active transportation infrastructure to decrease conflicts between modes and make public space safer for vulnerable pedestrians.},

@article{Lubin2012,
abstract = {Transportation barriers are often the reason for the discrepancy in the employment rate between people with disabilities and others, yet little information about the transportation barriers and the needs of people with disabilities who are searching for employment is available. The primary objective of this paper is to share valuable information from a unique survey of people with disabilities who were actively searching for employment in New Jersey. The paper examines the role of public transportation in providing job access to people with disabilities and provides information and insights on the availability, use, needs, barriers, and perceptions of the survey respondents about different public transit modes. The paper also discusses the implications for agencies that provide transportation for people with human services needs. Research shows that despite the frequent use of public transportation by job-seeking people with disabilities, many of them are dissatisfied with public transportation. Although satisfaction with vehicle equipment compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act seems high, many individuals are dissatisfied with the level of transit service and environmental barriers between homes and transit stations and stops. It can be inferred from the results that a multitude of strategies will be needed to address the travel needs and barriers of job-seeking people with disabilities in the state. In addition to providing assistance with transportation for people with human services needs and providing insights to vocational rehabilitation counselors, the study will serve as a means for laying the framework for more rigorous research on the transportation needs and barriers of people with disabilities.},
