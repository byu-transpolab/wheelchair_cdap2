 Individuals who use wheelchairs or who have other mobility challenges are sometimes unable to effectively access modern mobility as a service (MaaS) systems including application-based ridehailing and on-demand microtransit, etc. Even designing a MaaS targeted at these users is challenging, given the limited prior analysis of their travel and activity patterns. In this research, we present an initial attempt to model the daily activity pattern choice of respondents to the  2017 National Household Travel Survey who self-identify as using a wheelchair.  We find that wheelchair use is a significant predictor of activity patterns,  with individuals who use wheelchairs considerably less likely to choose out-of-home daily patterns. We additionally find that including wheelchair use as a variable in a model with a common person-type segmentation is statistically preferable to specifying wheelchair users as an independent segment. Further analysis of household-level coordination of daily activity patterns using more detailed surveys is warranted.

In 1990, the United States Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 
seeking to protect individuals with qualifying disabilities from discrimination
in seeking employment (Title I), while using public services including
transportation systems (Title II), and in public accommodations (Title III) among 
other specifics.  

The accommodation that has arguably caused the most challenges
for many transportation service providers has been ensuring equal
access for individuals who use wheelchairs. Buses and trains had to be reengineered
with low floors and access ramps; elevators and ramps needed to be installed 
in stations alongside escalators and stairs; and many traditional automobiles 
remain inaccessible --- or at least without substantial modification --- to
wheelchair users. This last challenge is a particular concern for transportation 
network companies (TNC's), who often use private vehicles owned by individual
operators.

Though the law only requires agencies to provide reasonable accommodation on and
does not try to establish equity in outcomes, the passage of 30 years provides a
convenient time to consider what gaps and challenges persist for wheelchair 
users in accessing and using the transportation system. Specifically, what gap 
exists in the observed travel behavior outcomes of wheelchair users vis a vis 
the non wheelchair using population, all else equal? And more importantly, how 
should this gap be applied within travel forecasting models and related planning
activities?

In this paper, we present an analysis of individual daily activity pattern choice
for a sample of respondents to the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (CITE), 
incorporating the individual's wheelchair use as an explanatory variable. 
We then apply the estimates obtained from the choice analysis in a modified
activity-based model for the Wasatch Front (Salt Lake City and outlying areas)
metropolitan region in Utah.

The paper proceeds in a typical fashion. A [literature review](#literature)
discusses prior attempts to evaluated and quantify the travel behavior of
users with disabilities. A section [describing the methodology](#methodology)
of the choice analysis and model application is followed by [a discussion of the results](#results)
from both analyses. The paper concludes with [a discussion ](#discussion)
of limitations in this analysis and associated avenues for future research and
policy intervention.
