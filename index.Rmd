In 1990, the United States Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 
seeking to protect individuals with qualifying disabilities from discrimination
in seeking employment (Title I), while using public services including
transportation systems (Title II), and in public accommodations (Title III) among 
other specifics.  

The accommodation that has arguably caused the most challenges
for many transportation service providers has been ensuring equal
access for individuals who use wheelchairs. Buses and trains had to be reengineered
with low floors and access ramps; elevators and ramps needed to be installed 
in stations alongside escalators and stairs; and many traditional automobiles 
remain inaccessible --- or at least without substantial modification --- to
wheelchair users. This last challenge is a particular concern for transportation 
network companies (TNC's), who often use private vehicles owned by individual
operators.

Though the law only requires agencies to provide reasonable accommodation on 
public conveyances and
does not try to establish equity in outcomes, the passage of 30 years provides a
convenient time to consider what gaps and challenges persist for wheelchair 
users in accessing and using the transportation system. Specifically, what gap 
exists in the observed travel behavior outcomes of wheelchair users vis a vis 
the non wheelchair using population, all else equal? And more importantly, how 
should this gap be applied within travel forecasting models and related planning
activities?

In this paper, we investigate the degree to which daily activity patterns are 
influenced by an individual's use of a wheelchair. This involves two separate
analyses: first, we model daily activity pattern choice using responses to the
2017 National Household Travel Survey (CITE), incorporating the individual's wheelchair use as an explanatory variable. 
Second, we apply the behavioral estimates obtained from the choice analysis
in a modified activity-based model for the Wasatch Front metropolitan region in
Utah to estimate the population-level effects of introducing wheelchair status in
a regional travel demand model.

The paper proceeds in a typical fashion. A [literature review](#literature)
discusses prior attempts to evaluated and quantify the travel behavior of
users with disabilities. A section [describing the methodology](#methodology)
of the choice analysis and model application is followed by [a discussion of the results](#results)
from both analyses. The paper concludes with [a discussion](#discussion)
of limitations in this analysis and associated avenues for future research and
policy intervention.
