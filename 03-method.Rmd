Activity-based models are a relatively mature construct in travel behavior
research and in practical demand forecasting \cite{rasouli2014activity}. Activity-based models attempt
to recreate the long- and short-term decision patterns of individuals within a
chain of econometric and statistical choice models. The specific sub-models included
in this chain can vary between specific implementations, but a recent 
open-source project --- ActivitySim \cite{activitysim} --- implements a popular 
set of models \cite{davidson2010ct}. Specifically, the ActivitySim demonstration
model is a part of the "Travel Model One" model for the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC, San Francisco Bay) \cite{erhardt2012mtc}.
For simplicity and comparison with other models, we apply the ActivitySim model
in this research.

The first model in the ActivitySim model chain is a \emph{daily activity pattern}
of the type described by Bradley and Vovsha \cite{Bradley2005}. This model 
allows individuals to choose one of three daily activity patterns:

  - Mandatory ($M$) daily patterns revolve around school and work activities that
  are typically considered non-discretionary. These activities and the travel
  to them anchor an individual's daily schedule, though other tours are possible.
  - Non-Mandatory ($NM$) daily patterns involve only discretionary activities: 
  shopping, maintenance, etc.
  - At-Home ($H$) daily patterns describe the schedule and activities of 
  individuals who never leave the home during the travel day.
  
The choice between the daily patterns is described with a multinomial logit
model \cite{Domencich1975}, where the utility functions for each option are
determined by an individual's socioeconomic characteristics and person type
segment. The specific innovation of the Bradley and Vovsha model
\cite{Bradley2005} is that the daily activity patterns are coordinated, or that
the choice of one individual in a household influences the choice probability of
other household members. We leave household-level coordination to future
research and instead examine individual uncoordinated choice utilities.

We do, however, adopt the person type segmentation strategy employed by
ActivitySim; segmentation allows for heterogeneity in available
alternatives and utility coefficients between individuals with highly divergent
expected behaviors. For example, full time workers and pre-driving age school children
will have strongly different responses to income, automobile availability, and 
and other variables in determining their most likely daily pattern.
A complete descriptive list of each person type is given in the data
section below. 

## Data
Data for this study comes from the 2017 NHTS \cite{nhts2017}. We restrict the
data to households where the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population size
is between one and three million people. There are 76,367 individuals in 36,497 
households that responded to the NHTS from these areas, though not all of these
records are useful due to missing or incomplete data in key variables.

The NHTS releases public data in separate tables for persons, households,
trips and vehicles; to determine the daily activity pattern for a given
individual it was necessary to transform the trips table into a table of
activities. We did this by reconstructing a schedule for each person from the
reported trip origin and destination activity codes. We then determined whether
each reported tour (a chain of activities away from the individual's home)
contained a mandatory school or work activity. If any tour contained a mandatory
activity, the person's entire daily activity pattern was classified as "mandatory";
if not, the daily activity pattern was "non-mandatory." By identifying respondents
in the persons table without records in the trips table, we can determine
individuals with a "home" daily activity pattern.

ActivitySim classifies persons into seven person segments, though we only
consider four types in this study, defined as follows:

   - Full-time workers (FW) - reported working "full-time" at their primary job.
   - Part-time worker (PW) - reported working "part-time" at their primary job,
   as well as any person who reported being a "non-worker" or "retired" who nevertheless
   reported a work or school activity.
   - Non-working adults (NW) - reported "unemployed" as their primary activity
 of the previous week, as well as individuals over 18 who were not classified
 elsewhere.
 - Retired (RT) - reported "retired" as their primary activity of the previous
 week, or who are over the age of 65 and reported that they were not workers.
 
The other three person types are university students, schoolchildren under
driving age, and driving-age schoolchildren. A limited number of individuals who
could plausibly be considered university students responded to the NHTS, so we
cannot estimate reliable choice models. Among schoolchildren of any age, too few
report using wheelchairs to justify including these segments in this study.


The NHTS has a number of questions where respondents can indicate a disability
for themselves or other household members. Each respondent is asked "Do you
have a condition or handicap that makes it difficult to travel outside of the
home?" If the answer is yes, several follow-up questions are asked, including
"Do you use any of the following medical devices? Select all that apply." The
list of medical devices respondents can indicated includes canes, walkers,
seeing-eye dogs, crutches, motorized scooters, manual wheelchairs, 
motorized wheelchairs, or something else (other). 
For this study, we identify wheelchair users as respondents who report using a
manual wheelchair, mechanical wheelchair, or motorized scooter.


The specific variables included in the daily activity pattern choice models
are based initially on the variables used in the ActivitySim example model (which are
those used in MTC Travel Model One. The variables available include the age of
the person and the household income treated as categorical ranges; gender, work,
and college degree status are treated as binary values. Automobile availability is
included via a binary "sufficiency" variable where a household with at least as
many vehicles as adults is considered "auto sufficient." Descriptive statistics
of the model variable within each person segment are given in
